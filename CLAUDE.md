## Architecture

- **Fully static** — `output: 'export'` generates HTML for all routes at build time
- **Client components** — FilterBar, ScreenshotStrip, Header (for interactivity)
- **Data-driven** — All app content in `src/data/apps.ts`, easy to extend
- **Detailed apps** with screenshots + change history (Aave, Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Leather, Lido, Mempool, MetaMask, Xverse)
- **Basic listings** with category, flows, and "coming soon" detail pages
- **Intelligence layer** — change detection, flow comparison, pattern search, AI insights, enhanced export, shareable collections, flow annotations, component extraction

## Capture Pipeline

Zero-cost, fully local pipeline — no API calls required.

```
crawl-app.mjs            →  raw screenshots + {slug}-raw.json
label-local.mjs          →  renamed files + {slug}-manifest.json
auto-tag.mjs             →  tags added to apps.ts screen entries
build-screen-analysis.mjs →  per-screen analysis data (runs before next build)
detect-elements.mjs      →  UI component bounding boxes (Claude Vision)
```

### Crawl modes

| Mode | Flag | Use case |
|------|------|----------|
| Public | _(default)_ | Landing pages, marketing sites |
| Login | `--login` | Manual browser login, then auto-crawl (exchanges, dashboards) |
| Wallet | `--wallet` | MetaMask extension, auto-approves popups (DeFi apps) |

### Examples

```bash
# Public crawl
node scripts/crawl-app.mjs --slug aave

# Authenticated crawl (login once, reuse session)
node scripts/crawl-app.mjs --slug binance --login

# DeFi crawl with MetaMask
node scripts/crawl-app.mjs --slug uniswap --wallet

# Crawl all apps
node scripts/crawl-app.mjs --all
```

### Browser Use MCP (Playwright fallback)

When the local Playwright crawler (`crawl-app.mjs`) fails — e.g. bot detection, CAPTCHA walls, Cloudflare challenges, or CI environment issues — a cloud browser fallback is available via the **Browser Use MCP**.

- **What it is:** A cloud-hosted browser automation API (browser-use.com) exposed as an MCP server
- **When to use it:** Only when Playwright fails. Not a replacement for the local pipeline.
- **How it's configured:** MCP server entry in `~/.claude.json` under the Darkscreen project (API key stored there, not in the repo)
- **Cost:** ~$0.006 per step (vs $0.00 for local Playwright)
- **Available tools:** `browser_task`, `monitor_task`, `list_browser_profiles`, `list_skills`, `get_cookies`

**Typical fallback workflow:**
1. Playwright crawl fails for an app (bot detection, network error, etc.)
2. Use `browser_task` to visit the app URL in a cloud browser and capture the needed information
3. The cloud browser has its own stealth/fingerprinting, so it often bypasses blocks that trip up local Playwright

**Important:** This is a paid API. Always try the local Playwright crawler first. Only fall back to Browser Use when Playwright cannot complete the job.

## App Logos

Every app in `apps.ts` has a corresponding logo at `/public/logos/{slug}.png`. Logos are displayed across 4 surfaces via the `AppLogo` component.

### Fetching logos

```bash
# Fetch logos for all apps missing a logo
npm run fetch-logos

# Fetch logo for a single new app
node scripts/fetch-logos.mjs --slug <slug>

# Re-fetch all logos (overwrite existing)
node scripts/fetch-logos.mjs --force

# Preview what would be fetched
node scripts/fetch-logos.mjs --dry-run
```

The script tries sources in waterfall order: Google Favicon (128px) → icon.horse → Clearbit → DuckDuckGo. Files < 1KB are skipped (likely placeholders). Batches 5 concurrent requests.

### When adding a new app

1. Add the app to `src/data/apps.ts`
2. Run `node scripts/fetch-logos.mjs --slug <slug>` to fetch its logo
3. If the script fails (all sources return tiny/broken images), manually save a PNG to `/public/logos/<slug>.png`
4. The `AppLogo` component handles missing logos gracefully — it shows a letter-circle fallback

### Where logos appear

| Surface | Size | File |
|---------|------|------|
| AppCard (library grid) | 20px | `src/components/AppCard.tsx` |
| LogoCloud (homepage footer) | 18px | `src/components/LogoCloud.tsx` |
| Hero (floating + inline cloud) | 16-64px | `src/components/Hero.tsx` |
| App detail header | 48px | `src/app/library/[slug]/page.tsx` |
| App detail "coming soon" | 40px | `src/app/library/[slug]/page.tsx` |

### AppLogo component

```tsx
<AppLogo slug="coinbase" name="Coinbase" size={24} />
```

Props: `slug`, `name`, `size` (default 24), `className`, `rounded`. Uses Next.js `<Image>` with `onError` fallback to a styled circle showing the first letter.

## Copy to Clipboard

Screenshots can be copied to clipboard from three surfaces: **ScreenModal**, **FlowPlayer**, and the **screen detail page**. Useful for pasting into Slack, Figma, Notion, etc.

### How it works

1. `copyImageToClipboard(imageUrl)` in `src/lib/clipboard.ts` fetches the image, draws it to a canvas, converts to PNG blob, and writes via `navigator.clipboard.write()`
2. `useClipboardSupport()` hook detects `ClipboardItem` support — Copy buttons auto-hide in unsupported browsers
3. Success/error feedback via the toast system

### Where Copy appears

| Surface | Location | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `ScreenModal` | Top bar, between Save and Download | |
| `FlowPlayer` | Top bar, between Play/Pause and Close | Hidden during paywall overlay, uses `stopPropagation` |
| Screen detail page | Sidebar, alongside Download | Via `ScreenActions` client component |

## Toast System

Lightweight notification system (no dependencies) following the existing context provider pattern.

- **Provider**: `ToastProvider` in `src/contexts/ToastContext.tsx`, wraps the app in `Providers.tsx`
- **Hook**: `useToast()` returns `showToast(message, type?)` where type is `'success' | 'error'`
- **UI**: `src/components/Toast.tsx` — dark card with green (success) / red (error) accent border
- **Behavior**: Auto-dismiss after 2s, max 3 stacked, portal-rendered at `z-[120]`, fixed bottom-right

## SEO

Full documentation in [`docs/SEO.md`](docs/SEO.md). Summary:

- **Metadata**: `generateMetadata` on all 15 dynamic page types (title, description, OG image)
- **JSON-LD**: 6 structured data types — WebsiteJsonLd and OrganizationJsonLd on every page, BreadcrumbJsonLd on 13 page types, CollectionPageJsonLd on 6, SoftwareAppJsonLd on app detail, FAQJsonLd on 3
- **FAQ sections**: Programmatic FAQ generators + visible sections on homepage, category, and flow pages
- **Sitemap**: Auto-generated from `getAllSeoRoutes()` with 5 priority tiers
- **robots.txt**: Allow all + 11 named AI crawlers explicitly allowed
- **LLM context**: `public/llms.txt` (concise) and `public/llms-full.txt` (full product directory)
- **Content enrichment**: Data-driven prose on compare, alternatives, and screenshots pages

Key files: `src/components/JsonLd.tsx`, `src/data/seo.ts`, `src/app/sitemap.ts`, `src/app/robots.ts`

## Intelligence Layer

Ten features documented in [`docs/FEATURES.md`](docs/FEATURES.md):

1. **Enhanced Change Detection** — Weekly-grouped change feed with before/after thumbnails, diff percentages, homepage banner
2. **Flow Comparison** — `/compare-flows` tool: select 2-4 apps + flow type, side-by-side or step-by-step view
3. **Pattern Search** — Unified `/patterns` library with 18 crypto UX patterns, searchable with category filters
4. **AI Insights** — Build-time Claude Sonnet 4.6 analysis of diffs → `/insights` page with editorial summaries
5. **Enhanced Export** — `ExportMenu` with 7 formats: PNG, clipboard, flow strips (H/V), Figma JSON, metadata, ZIP
6. **Shareable Collections** — Public share links via Firestore `sharedCollections`, per-screen notes, nanoid share IDs
7. **Weekly Email Digest** — Dark-themed HTML digest of weekly changes, sent via Brevo transactional API to subscribers
8. **Flow-Level Annotations** — Per-screen analysis (screen type, friction points, interactive elements, CTAs) shown in ScreenModal + FlowSummary bar
9. **Component-Level Extraction** — Claude Vision bounding box detection for 44 UI element types, SVG overlay in ScreenModal
10. **Authenticated Crawl Agent** — Encrypted Chromium profile sync, separate CI workflow for 32 login apps

### Generating insights

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... npm run generate-insights
```

Reads `data/*-diff.json`, filters `diffPercent > 3%`, sends to Claude, writes `src/data/insights.ts`. Incremental and idempotent.

### Generating screen analysis

```bash
node scripts/build-screen-analysis.mjs
```

Reads all `*-extracted.json` files, generates `src/data/screen-analysis.ts` with per-screen analysis (screen type, friction points, interactive elements, CTAs). Runs automatically as part of `npm run build`.

### Detecting UI components

```bash
# Single app
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... node scripts/detect-elements.mjs --slug coinbase

# All apps
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... node scripts/detect-elements.mjs --all

# Preview without API calls
node scripts/detect-elements.mjs --all --dry-run
```

Uses Claude Vision (Haiku) to detect bounding boxes for 44 `GranularElementTag` types across all screenshots. Writes to `src/data/elements.json`. Flags: `--slug`, `--all`, `--force`, `--dry-run`, `--model`, `--concurrency`.

### Access control

| Feature | Free | Pro |
|---------|------|-----|
| AI insights | 2/week | Unlimited |
| Batch export | — | Full |
| Figma JSON export | — | Full |
| Shared collections | 1 | Unlimited |

## Weekly Email Digest

Subscribers receive a dark-themed HTML email summarizing weekly screenshot changes, sent via Brevo transactional API.

- **Sender**: `Darkscreens <digest@darkscreens.xyz>`
- **Brevo list ID 2** = "Weekly Digest" subscribers
- **Signup flow**: `EmailCapture` component writes to Firestore, then calls the `brevoSync` Firebase Function to add the email to Brevo list 2
- **Firebase Function**: `brevoSync` in `firebase-functions/src/index.ts` — HTTP function that adds an email to the Brevo contact list

### Sending the digest

```bash
# Send to all subscribers
BREVO_API_KEY=... node scripts/send-weekly-digest.mjs

# Preview without sending
node scripts/send-weekly-digest.mjs --dry-run

# Send test email
BREVO_API_KEY=... node scripts/send-weekly-digest.mjs --test you@example.com
```

Reads diff JSON / auto-changes data, builds dark-themed HTML email, sends via Brevo. Runs automatically in the weekly crawl pipeline after `generate-changes`.

### Migrating waitlist

```bash
BREVO_API_KEY=... node scripts/migrate-waitlist-to-brevo.mjs
```

One-time migration of Firestore waitlist emails to Brevo contact list 2.

## Authenticated Crawl Agent

Login apps (exchanges, dashboards) are crawled separately from public apps using encrypted Chromium profiles.

- **Config**: `scripts/auth-config.json` — 32 login apps with login URLs, form selectors, success indicators
- **Profile encryption**: AES-256 with `DARKSCREEN_CRED_KEY` secret
- **CI workflow**: `.github/workflows/weekly-crawl-auth.yml` — runs every Monday at 9 AM UTC (3 hours after public crawl)

### Profile management

```bash
# Upload encrypted profiles to R2
DARKSCREEN_CRED_KEY=... bash scripts/upload-profiles.sh

# Download and decrypt profiles from R2
DARKSCREEN_CRED_KEY=... bash scripts/download-profiles.sh
```

Profiles are stored encrypted in the `darkscreen-screenshots` R2 bucket. CI downloads and decrypts them before crawling login apps.

## Design System

- Background: `#0C0C0E` (near-black)
- Cards: `#151518` with `#27272A` borders
- Text: `#F4F4F5` (primary), `#A1A1AA` (secondary), `#71717A` (tertiary)
- Accents: white / zinc for interactive elements
- Fonts: Space Grotesk (headings), Inter (body), Fira Code (mono/data)
- Subtle dot-grid texture overlay, card hover border shifts

## Automated Weekly Pipeline (CI)

Screenshots are automatically refreshed every Monday via GitHub Actions.

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/weekly-crawl.yml` — runs every Monday at 6 AM UTC.

**Pipeline steps (public crawl — 6 AM UTC):**
1. Download current screenshots from R2 (via Cloudflare REST API)
2. Archive them locally (for diffing)
3. Recrawl stale public apps (7+ days old, login apps auto-skipped)
4. Diff new screenshots against archive (pixel-level via `pixelmatch`)
5. Generate auto-detected change records
6. Send weekly digest email (via Brevo)
7. Upload new screenshots to R2
8. Commit data changes (`apps.ts`, `auto-changes.ts`)
9. Build and deploy to Cloudflare Pages

**Auth crawl pipeline** (`.github/workflows/weekly-crawl-auth.yml` — 9 AM UTC):
1. Download + decrypt Chromium profiles from R2
2. Crawl 32 login apps using stored sessions
3. Encrypt + upload updated profiles to R2
4. Upload new screenshots to R2
5. Commit + deploy

**Key scripts (CI-specific):**

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/download-r2-screenshots.sh` | Download screenshots from R2 bucket via Cloudflare API |
| `scripts/archive-screens.mjs` | Copy current screenshots to dated archive folder |
| `scripts/recrawl-stale.mjs` | Re-crawl apps not updated in N days |
| `scripts/diff-screens.mjs` | Pixel-diff current vs archived screenshots |
| `scripts/generate-changes.mjs` | Generate `auto-changes.ts` from diff JSON |
| `scripts/send-weekly-digest.mjs` | Build + send weekly digest email via Brevo |
| `scripts/upload-screenshots.sh` | Upload screenshots to R2 bucket via wrangler |
| `scripts/upload-profiles.sh` | Encrypt + upload Chromium profiles to R2 |
| `scripts/download-profiles.sh` | Download + decrypt Chromium profiles from R2 |

**Required GitHub Secrets** (Settings > Secrets > Actions):

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare account ID (dashboard sidebar) |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | API token with Cloudflare Pages (Edit) + Workers R2 Storage (Edit) |
| `BREVO_API_KEY` | Brevo transactional API key (weekly digest email) |
| `DARKSCREEN_CRED_KEY` | AES-256 encryption key for Chromium profile sync |

**R2 bucket:** `darkscreen-screenshots` — stores all labeled screenshots (not raw).

**Manual trigger:** `gh workflow run weekly-crawl.yml` (public) or `gh workflow run weekly-crawl-auth.yml` (auth)

## Environment Variables

None required for local development.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

## Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
# Builds Next.js static export → out/, then deploys to Cloudflare Pages via wrangler
```

**Important:** The `firebase-functions/` directory contains Firebase Cloud Functions (Stripe webhooks, etc.). It was renamed from `functions/` because Wrangler auto-detects any `functions/` directory as Cloudflare Pages Functions and tries to compile it, which fails. Do not rename it back to `functions/`.
